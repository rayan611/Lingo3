# Development Handoff — Lingo3 Grammar Manager
Date: 2026-11-02
Status: PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION — NOT DEPLOYED
Branch: feature/grammar-manager-phase1

Implemented and committed:
- docs/GRAMMAR_MANAGER_PHASE1.md: phase-one scope and acceptance checklist.
- src/db/db.ts: additive Dexie version 8 grammarSections and grammarRules stores, preserving existing tables.
- src/db/grammar.ts: typed local section/rule records and basic offline CRUD, soft deletion and language search.

Not implemented:
- UI and navigation.
- Supabase migration, RLS and cross-device sync.
- Curated standard grammar library and personal-copy behavior.
- Anonymous-to-account grammar adoption.
- Grammar section update/delete, parent cycle checks, cascade semantics.
- Tests and verified backup/restore.

Verification: GitHub commits confirmed. No typecheck, npm test, browser test or deployment performed. No production database changes.
Rollback: Production Vercel deployment dpl_AGqu3263JvTXk3SpAnBUeKDAoaCU previously identified as rollback candidate; database restore not verified.
Risk: Production and preview share Supabase. Never deploy schema changes until backup and restore are verified.
Next action: inspect actual current database schema and backup success, add isolated migration and tests, implement UI and sync, then stage and release.
